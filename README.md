**🏦 Bank Churn Rate Analysis Using Artificial Neural Networks**

A Deep Learning Project
Analyze and predict customer churn for banks using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

**📌 Project Overview**

Customer churn is a significant challenge for banks, impacting revenue and growth. This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze customer behavior, predict churn, and identify key factors influencing customer retention.

The insights derived from this project can help banks devise strategies to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
